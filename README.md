# Cat and Dog classification project
Cat and dog classification is a task in computer vision that involves building a model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. It is a popular problem in machine learning and deep learning, and has numerous applications in areas such as image recognition, surveillance, and autonomous vehicles.

The process typically involves training a supervised machine learning algorithm on a large dataset of labeled images of cats and dogs, and then evaluating the performance of the model on a separate test dataset. Deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often used to achieve high accuracy on this task.

The goal of cat and dog classification is to create a model that can accurately and efficiently identify whether an image contains a cat or a dog.
